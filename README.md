# PhoneCoolerRenovation
This project is about the renovation of my old broken phone cooler I bought awhile ago. The detail is in this repository including the solidworks file and the media for more clearer visual

Hi guys, welcome to my Github. This project is mainly related to mechanical skill  rather than software skill. I designed every part in Solidworks, then save as STL file for 3D printing. The design including 4 main pieces: Battery placement, Fanbase, Aluminum cooler base, and the top cover for the design. The other components are battery cells and holder; jumper wires, a 12V 4*4*1.2cm fan, 2-legged switch, aluminum cooler, and the small PCB that comes with the original cooler product.

After 3D printing, I did some assembly to have the product as you see today.
To use the product, simply plug in typce connector to the PCB to turn the cooler on, then switch the button for the fan to start (the aluminum part really need good cool air to heat down or else the whole part will be super hot and will decrease product's longetivity. This 12V fan is more than enough for the cooling part even though it does make some small noise and I might have to be used to it (but I can wear headphone when in my room so I consider this is not a mayjor issue).

That's it guy, enjoy!
